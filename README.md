# CompliantRMed

As R continues to gain momentum in clinical research, regulatory agencies are paying closer attention to how it’s used in regulated environments. Whether supporting statistical analysis, data visualization, or automation pipelines, R packages must meet stringent validation requirements to be considered fit for use in clinical trials and other regulated activities. But what does validation actually mean in this context—and how can researchers, data scientists, and system administrators ensure their R-based tools hold up under scrutiny? This talk will walk through practical strategies for validating R packages in alignment with regulatory expectations, including those from FDA, EMA, and under ICH guidelines such as E6(R3), E9, and M10. We’ll explore the intersection of open-source software and GxP compliance, unpacking the nuances of how to assess, document, and justify the use of community-developed or custom-built R packages. Attendees will learn: • What regulators expect when R is used in a clinical or GxP-regulated environment. • How to categorize R packages based on risk and intended use. • Validation approaches for both CRAN packages and internally developed tools. • How to document package selection, qualification, and performance testing. • Best practices for ongoing change control, version tracking, and reproducibility. • Real-world examples of validation frameworks and testing workflows using tools like {testthat}, {renv}, and {devtools}. Whether you’re part of a small academic research team or a large sponsor organization, this session offers practical guidance for creating defensible validation packages that support transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance. We’ll also touch on tools and templates that can help streamline validation documentation and collaborate with Quality Assurance teams more effectively. By the end of this talk, you’ll walk away with a clearer understanding of what it takes to “make R compliant,” how to integrate validation into your development workflows, and how to future-proof your R environment in a regulated research setting. Because in clinical research, compliance isn’t just a checkbox—it’s part of building trust in our data, our methods, and ultimately, the science we support.
